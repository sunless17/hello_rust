# fundamentals
make some cookie-cutter functions to test my understanding of:
- variables
- data types (+ vectors)
- functions (+ closures)
- control flow (+ match)
- loops

# lessons
- use consts when the value shouldn't change (preferrably as a global variable)
- .len() = print the number of characters or items in a compound type
- .parse() = converts the type of a value to the explicit type (requires .expect())
- chars include emojis
- statements don't return value, expressions do
- fn's that have a return value typically assigned to a variable

# quest
- multiple types and values returned from a function
